Python-Guild
============

Guild is a basic pipelineable Actor system, currently based around threads
and a developer friendly syntax. In particular it introduces 2 notions to an
actor system - the idea of late binding, and of having common names (or aliases)
for the purposes of enabling pipelining.

It's inspired by Kamaelia, but with all the ugly parts removed.
